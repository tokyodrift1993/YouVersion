# YouVersion

Express Rest API for getting verses and such from YouVersion.

# Building and Running

Install `pnpm`:

```
npm i --location=global pnpm@8
```

First step is of course installing the modules

```
pnpm i
```

## Building

To build I think you can just use the `tsc` command.

```bash
tsc
```

If you cannot use `tsc` try

```bash
npx tsc
```

## Running

And to run use

```bash
pnpm run start
```

# Making Requests

| Query   | Default | Required | Example     |
|---------|---------|----------|-------------|
| book    | None    | true     | John or JHN |
| chapter | 1       | false    | 7 or 10     |
| verses  | 1       | false    | 1-3 or 7-10 |
| version | KJV     | false    | KJV or NLT  |

## Examples

Gets `John 1:1 NIV`

```
https://serverAddress.com/api/v1/verse?book=John
```

<br>

Gets `John 3:16 NLT`

```
https://serverAddress.com/api/v1/verse?book=John&chapter=3&verses=16&version=NLT
```

---

## Responses

Requests return a JSON object and a status code.

### Good Responses

A good API call responds with a `200 OK` and the requested verse(s).

```json
{
  "citation": "John 3:16 NLT",
  "passage": "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
}
```

<br>

Checking the API status is pretty simple, just make a request to the following route and if everything is fine it'll
respond with a `200 OK` and no JSON object.

```
https://serverAddress.com/api/v1/status
```

### Bad Responses

If no book is specified in the query, it will prompt a `400 Bad Response` and an error message

```json
{
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Missing field 'book'"
}
```

<br>

Trying to access a book that does not exist will prompt a similar `400 Bad Response` but with a different error message

```json
{
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Could not find book 'Coffee' by name or alias."
}
```
